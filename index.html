In all seriousness, I hacked this tool together because of the lack of alternatives. 
It works great for my purpose, that is, evaluating some hypotheses from my master thesis.

If you are interested in some of my more professional work or want to work together, don't
hesitate and shoot me an email:
    mail@<this domain>

In case you feel like a pirate for whatever reason, well, I cannot stop you.
